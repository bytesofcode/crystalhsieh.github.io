<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>

<h3>My name is Rachel. </h2>

<h2>My favorite flavor of ice cream flavor is Mint-Cookies & Cream!Yum!</h3>

<h4>I think my least favorite food would have to be seafood, though I don't care for bacon much either.</h4>

<h3>If I could be any fruit, I think I would be a avacodo
because barried deep within the kindness, there is a horible
darkness waiting for a chance to emurge.</h3>
